# Jung

Jung is a small lisp-like calculator language I wrote for my final project for CSC402 at URI. 

Jung compiles down to a bytecode which is read by a VM. The VM and bytecode are heavily modeled after Dr. Lutz Hamel's Exp1Bytecode.

I used this project as a first endeavor to compilers. I learned an incredible amount about the code generation process and the nature of compilation.

## Running Jung
```bash
python main.py examples/fizzbuzz.lisp
